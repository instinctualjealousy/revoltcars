      <h3>Tracks</h3>These are the tracks which are currently
      compatible with Future Cars. I did not create these tracks, I
      have only modified them with new AI lines and UltraGrav force
      fields to keep these cars welded to the ground. If you have
      any objections to your tracks being hosted here, please let
      me know and I'll remove them (which would be a shame, but oh
      well!)<br>

      <h3>Cars</h3>To install the future cars, you'll want to
      remove all pre-existing cars (except any future cars that
      aren't included in this pack) in the /cars directory. Then
      download the <a href="FutureCars.zip">FutureCars.zip</a> file
      and unzip it into your Re-Volt directory.
      <h3>Sound</h3>You can download a small <a href=
      "FutureCarsWavs.zip">sound pack</a> that replaces some of the
      skids, hits and engine sounds with effects that are a little
      more aggressive.
