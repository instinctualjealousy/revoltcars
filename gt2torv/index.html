            This isn't a tutorial on how to use ZModeler or Lithium
            Unwrapper. You'll need your own wheel mesh, and to map
            the car or wheels in such a way that it all fits on the
            map. You can use my wheels if you wish, scloink's,
            stock wheels et cetera. The opportunities are quite
            large.<br>

              </li>
            </ul>First things first, though, is that you have to
            know ZModeler (or your 3D software of choice);
            including a cursory knowledge of UV mapping (I've
            always been terrible at it).
            <hr>
            <h2 id="chap1">Chapter 1: Retrieving mesh and the
            basics</h2>Well, now that we've got that out of the
            way, pop either the <strong>Arcade</strong> or
            <strong>Simulation</strong> disc in your CD drive (real
            or virtual). Make a new folder, name it, and make sure
            it's where you'd like it. Start GT2Vol and choose the
            directory you just created (it's at the top of the
            software). Deselect <strong>carobj</strong> from the
            list of items to skip, as this contains all the game's
            car meshes.<br>
            <br>
            Click the <strong>Do it</strong> button when you are
            sure this is where you want to extract the files. It'll
            start doing its magic!<br>
            <br>
            <img src="assets/MpcG4df.webp"><br>
            <br>
            Find the GT2 CD in the file selector and go inside it.
            Choose the <strong>GT2.VOL</strong> file!<br>
            <br>
            <img src="assets/E6UFXTN.webp"><br>
            <br>
            Now just wait for it to finish, and then go to the
            <strong>carobj</strong> folder inside of the folder you
            extracted to. This folder contains *.gz archives (the
            cars) with double extensions. The first extension is
            the type of data contained. Now, you're probably
            curious of why there's so many files for each ID#,
            right?<br>
            <br>
            <h4>Let me explain:</h4>The file extensions are more
            descriptive than you may think at first glance. The
            first letter is always <strong>C</strong>,
            <strong>c</strong>ar. The second letter is either
            <strong>D</strong> or <strong>N</strong>. This
            signifies the <strong>d</strong>ay or
            <strong>n</strong>ight variants of the car, chosen by
            the game to fit the track environment's time of day.
            This of course changes things like whether pop-up
            headlights are up, and if headlights and rear lights
            are on. The third letter is <strong>O</strong> or
            <strong>P</strong>- <strong>o</strong>bject and
            <strong>p</strong>aint accordingly. So if you have a
            *.c<strong>np</strong> file, it's the
            "<strong>n</strong>ight <strong>p</strong>aint" of said
            car, or if you have a *.c<strong>do</strong> file it's
            "<strong>d</strong>ay <strong>o</strong>bject" and so
            on. Naturally, if you convert the night object (3D
            mesh), you want to convert the night paint (texture)
            alongside it- if you wish to go the texture conversion
            route, that is!<br>
            <br>
            <img src="assets/KjHHkpS.webp"><br>
            <br>
            We're only worried about the mesh for now, though. The
            prefixed letters and numbers are the vehicle ID. You
            can find out what car is what by referencing the <a id=
            "next" style="display: inline;" href="gt2id.html"
            target="_self">ID list</a>. I'll be using a day mesh
            for this example. When you decide which car you wish to
            work on, open the *.cdo.gz version of the applicable
            ID.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Extract the *.cdo out of the
            archive!</strong><br>
            <br>
            <a href="assets/mftnr.zip"><img src=
            "assets/kRE5LWw.webp"></a><br>
            If you're lazy, <strong>click the image
            above!</strong><br>
            <br>
            Import this file in ZModeler:<br>
            <br>
            <img src="assets/hkFybcp.webp"><br>
            <br>
            Be surprised- as you'll notice that these files include
            multiple models for level-of-detail purposes. You only
            need the highest detail mesh, so discard the rest
            (cdo[0] and cdo[1]). Let's start thinking about
            textures in the next chapter!<br>

            <h2 id="chap2">Chapter 2: Procuring a texture
            map</h2>There's multiple ways you can go about
            this.<br>
            <br>
            <h4>The three methods I've used:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Real life or other source images of car aspects
              (front/side/rear) made into a map</li>
              <li>GT2 screenshots of car aspects
              (front/side/rear)</li>
              <li>GT2 texture conversion and editing</li>
            </ul>I recommend using <a href=
            "../tools/GT2wheelsPNG.zip">GT2 Wheel Shop textures</a>
            for the wheels (if you don't use the original texture)
            since it's aesthetically fitting.<br>
            <br>
            The first and second methods for making a texture map
            are a free-for-all. Because of this, I won't elaborate
            on it much. The third and final method is something
            that actually takes some previous knowledge to do, so I
            will expand upon that.<br>
            <br>
            You'll need to extract the texture for the mesh you're
            converting. Since our example is mftnr.cdo(.gz), we'll
            need to extract <strong>mftnr.cdp</strong> from
            *.cdp.gz. Open the archive, and extract
            <strong>mftnr.cdp</strong> from it. Place it anywhere
            you wish, but remember where you put it. We'll be
            opening it with PSicture next.<br>
            <br>
            Car textures in GT2 can only be read in raw mode-
            unlike the *.tim files that are very easy to work with!
            Sadly, those *.tim(s) are only used for wheels procured
            in the game from the Wheel Shop. Opening GT2 car
            textures in raw mode takes very specific values to
            achieve an adequate result.<br>
            <br>
            Open PSicture. CTRL+R or "File -&gt; Open as raw...".
            Select your *.cdp file. And fill out the boxes
            <strong>exactly as they are here:</strong><br>
            <br>
            <img src="assets/QjTk6Bg.webp"><br>
            <br>
            You will likely notice some wrong colors after import.
            This is a small annoyance- different sections of the
            bitmap will be rendered correctly under different
            palettes. To cycle through the palette, press F8. If
            you find something correctly rendered under a certain
            palette, save the image as a bitmap (CTRL+S or "File
            -&gt; Save image") for later use. Keep saving bitmaps!
            If you wish to cycle back, press F7. You'll end up
            saving at least a few different bitmaps because of
            this.<br>
            <br>
            Notice some of the areas are rendered correctly and
            <strong>others are not:</strong><br>
            <br>
            <img src="assets/1PbRtae.webp"><br>
            <br>
            After you have all your different bitmaps together,
            it'll be up to you to build a map out of these
            different palette chunks. If certain aspects of the
            texture look like they'd be hard to UV map for your
            skill level, feel free to take screenshots of the
            problem areas for easier mapping or make your own
            textures. Try to keep it as seamless as possible. I
            won't continue further because I think you've got this.
            <hr>
            <h2 id="chap3">Chapter 3: ZModeler to Lithium Unwrapper
            and back</h2>So you have that car imported still, yes?
            The LOD models deleted? Good. Now, here's what you need
            to do. This part is indeed a little iffy, so any
            attention here is useful. Delete all materials and add
            a new material- the bitmap you made in the previous
            chapter. When all is good, export this as a *.3ds. Why?
            Because we're leaving ZModeler. I personally never
            liked ZModeler for UV mapping.<br>
            <br>
            If you have a better understanding of ZModeler's UV
            system than LithUnwrap's and don't feel like changing
            workflow, skip to <a href="#chap5">Chapter 5</a>.<br>
            If you <strong>do</strong> wish to use Lithium
            Unwrapper, I'm not explaining its use here, but I'll go
            through the basics!<br>
            <br>
            Open Lithium Unwrapper. Go to "File -&gt; Model -&gt;
            Open" in the menu, and open the *.3ds file you created.
            With the associated material, it should load fully.
            There are many possible ways to unwrap the mesh, and
            given the freedom of selection, it's very easy and
            nimble at its task. Once you have the car fully UV
            mapped, "File -&gt; Model -&gt; Save". Re-import this
            into ZModeler- however, there will be another
            hair-pulling step involved that you may not have seen
            coming! <em>You see</em>- when you converted the file
            to *.3ds, you <strong>totally messed up the vertex
            normals!</strong> The normals need recalculated. I
            personally use FCE Finish for this task.
            <hr>
            <h2 id="chap4">Chapter 4: FCE Finish</h2>Since we're
            moving to a different application, I need to take that
            mesh I just imported back into ZModeler and export is
            as an *.fce, the NFS4 format. Once the file is
            exported, open it in FCE Finish. Its link after install
            might be broken like it was for me. That's some quality
            workmanship. It isn't hard to find in <strong>Program
            Files</strong>, however. Another note: you'll get a
            little pop-up that there is no help.dat. Just skip
            through it!<br>
            <br>
            Select <strong>Surfaces</strong> after the file is
            open:<br>
            <br>
            <img src="assets/V3KfLye.webp"><br>
            <br>
            When you click it, <strong>you'll get a
            pop-up:</strong><br>
            <br>
            <img src="assets/Mb72XiZ.webp"><br>
            <br>
            Hit <strong>OK</strong>. Now, let the adjusting begin.
            You can get real technical, but I'd recommend just
            clicking <strong>Smooth by angle limit</strong>. The
            farthest right option, <strong>No</strong>, is the most
            surefire one; if you want to retain some edges by angle
            amount, tweak to taste. When all looks good, simply
            save the *.fce.
            <hr>
            <h2 id="chap5">Chapter 5: Final Preparations for
            Re-Volt!</h2>This is where it'll start getting a
            <em>lot</em> like NFS4 conversions, it's the home
            stretch! I'll assume that whichever path was taken, you
            have all models and textures sorted. At this point,
            you'll want to do the standard car export procedure so
            that it actually works right in Re-Volt (isn't clear or
            black). Once you have it exported and shaded, we need
            to decide on a scale. I use a scale of 0.5x, but if you
            want it closer to NFS4 TMaM size, you'll want to scale
            it closer to 0.4x. You're almost there! Time to make
            some inspired parameters, unlike me!<br>
            <br>
            <h4>Extra tips:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Delete extraneous polygons from the mesh if you
              aren't going to use them (there are some extra
              polygons for some elements on the cars that you may
              or may not want)</li>
              <li>If you're handy with modeling- rework the wheel
              wells because the transparency trick doesn't work
              well and Skarma also hates it</li>
              <li>Use LithUnwrap's optimize options for clearing
              out unneeded vertices before exporting the *.3ds
              file</li>
            </ul><strong>I wish you luck. If you need personal
